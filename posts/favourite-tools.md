I will try to keep an updated list of my favorite tools here.

Let's start!

# PDF

- [PDF-Xchange Editor](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor) from [Tracker Software](https://www.tracker-software.com/) is hands-down my favorite PDF Editor.
  I like it because:
  - It is pretty, light-weight, featureful and very easy to use.
  - It is actively maintained & developed.
  - Tracker's customer support is something I have not seen anywhere else. Amazing.
  - They have a buy-once licensing scheme instead of a subscription model.
