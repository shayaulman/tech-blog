## Introduction

I will try to keep an updated list of my favorite tools here.

It will be split as follows:
- Tools that I want to give a massive shout-out for. These are tools that I think are amazing and more people should know about them and use them. I will add to each item a short description and some reasons why I like them so much.
- This will be followed by a list of tools I use, grouped by category. These tools are chosen by me as the best in category for the job I use them for. However they are either already very well-known, or just not good enough to deserve a massive shout out.

Let's start!

## Big shout out for these tools ðŸ“¢

These are tools that I think are amazing and more people should know about them and use them. The tools are listed in no particular order.
### [PDF-Xchange Editor](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor) (Freemium)

[PDF-Xchange Editor](https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor) from [Tracker Software](https://www.tracker-software.com/) is hands-down my favorite PDF Editor.

I like it because:
  - It is pretty, light-weight, featureful and very easy to use.
  - It is actively maintained & developed.
  - Tracker's customer support is something I have not seen anywhere else. The support personal are  knowledgeable, friendly and very responsive. No question in the [support forum](https://forum.tracker-software.com/viewforum.php?f=50) is left unanswered, no email is ignored. Just overall amazing.
- They have a buy-once licensing scheme instead of a subscription model.

### [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) (Free, Proprietary)

[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) is an amazing file search tool from [voidtools](https://www.voidtools.com/). Now, I would have thought (and still do think so...) that Everything is a terrible name for a tool ("Hey, have you heard of everything?", "Heard of what??? ðŸ˜•"). But apparently it is good enough to come out first in a [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=Everything) for the word "everything".

My favorite use for it, is something it wasn't designed for. I

I like it because:
 - It is very light-weight, extremely fast and very featureful.
 - It is actively maintained and seems to be of very high quality code.
