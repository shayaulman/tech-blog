I will try to keep an updated list of my favourite tools here.

Let's start!

# PDF

- PDFXchange Editor from Tracker Software is hands-down my favourite PDF Editor.
  I like it because:
  - It is pretty, light-weight, featurefull and very easy to use.
  - It is actively maintained & developed.
  - Tracker's customer support is something I have not seen anywhere else. Amazing.
  - They have a buy-once licensing scheme instead of a subscription model.
