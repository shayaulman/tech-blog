These are tools that I think are amazing and more people should know about them and use them. I will add to each item a short description and some reasons why I like them so much.</li>\n<li>This will be followed by a list of tools I use, grouped by category. These tools are chosen by me as the best in category for the job I use them for. However they are either already very well-known, or just not good enough to deserve a massive shout out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's start!</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-shout-out-for-these-tools-%F0%9F%93%A2\">Big shout out for these tools ðŸ“¢ <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#big-shout-out-for-these-tools-%F0%9F%93%A2\">#</a></h2>\n<p>These are tools that I think are amazing and more people should know about them and use them. The tools are listed in no particular order.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pdf-xchange-editor-(freemium)\"><a href=\"https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor\">PDF-Xchange Editor</a> (Freemium) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#pdf-xchange-editor-(freemium)\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor\">PDF-Xchange Editor</a> from <a href=\"https://www.tracker-software.com/\">Tracker Software</a> is hands-down my favorite PDF Editor.</p>\n<p>I like it because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is pretty, light-weight, featureful and very easy to use.</li>\n<li>It is actively maintained &amp; developed.</li>\n<li>Tracker's customer support is something I have not seen anywhere else. The support personal are  knowledgeable, friendly and very responsive. No question in the <a href=\"https://forum.tracker-software.com/viewforum.php?f=50\">support forum</a> is left unanswered, no email is ignored. Just overall amazing.</li>\n<li>They have a buy-once licensing scheme instead of a subscription model.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"everything-(free%2C-proprietary)\"><a href=\"https://www.voidtools.com/\">Everything</a> (Free, Proprietary) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#everything-(free%2C-proprietary)\">#</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.voidtools.com/\">Everything</a> is an amazing file search tool from <a href=\"https://www.voidtools.com/\">voidtools</a>. Now, I would have thought (and still do think so...) that Everything is a terrible name for a tool (&quot;Hey, have you heard of everything?&quot;, &quot;Heard of what??? ðŸ˜•&quot;). But apparently it is good enough to come out first in a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Everything\">Google search</a> for the word &quot;everything&quot;.</p>\n<p>My favorite use for it, is something it wasn't designed for. I</p>\n<p>I like it because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is very light-weight, extremely fast and very featureful.</li>\n<li>It is actively maintained and seems to be of very high quality code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"process-hacker-(open-source)\"><a href=\"https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/nightly.php\">Process Hacker</a> (Open source) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#process-hacker-(open-source)\">#</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"ranger-(open-source)\"><a href=\"https://ranger.github.io/\">Ranger</a> (Open source) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#ranger-(open-source)\">#</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"fork-(proprietary)\"><a href=\"https://fork.dev/\">Fork</a> (Proprietary) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#fork-(proprietary)\">#</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"windows-terminal-(open-source)\">Windows Terminal (Open source) <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#windows-terminal-(open-source)\">#</a></h3>\n<h2 id=\"mini-shout-out-for-these%3A\">Mini shout out for these: <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#mini-shout-out-for-these%3A\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"7-zip\">7-zip <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#7-zip\">#</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"clink\">Clink <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#clink\">#</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"tableplus\">TablePlus <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#tableplus\">#</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"paint.net\"><a href=\"http://Paint.net\">Paint.net</a> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#paint.net\">#</a></h3>\n<h2 id=\"the-full-unabridged-list-of-stuff-i-use\">The full unabridged list of stuff I use <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#the-full-unabridged-list-of-stuff-i-use\">#</a></h2>\n<p><em>to be continued...</em></p>\n",
